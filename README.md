# Image Processing - CPU vs GPU

[Report PDF](https://github.com/dmconnolly/Image-Processing/blob/master/Report.pdf)

This project focuses on the development of a software solution for evaluating relative the speed of image processing of central processing units versus graphical processing units.

For this comparison, an application was created which receives several series of images generated by an external source. These images were then processed on both pieces of hardware using the same algorithm.

The measured results show that the graphical processing unit is significantly faster than the central processing unit at tracking features between images in the scenarios tested.
